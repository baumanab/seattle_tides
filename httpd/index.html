 The explanatory data visualization below is in fulfillment of the requirements for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Project 6: "Make an Effective Data Visualization." 
 The data visualization is designed to help the user determine when to make the ~2 mile hike between two Seattle Parks, Carkeek and Golden Gardens, 
 via beach exposed at low tide.  A chart is displayed for each of the next four viable days, from the selected day (initial visualization is the current day).
The tide data in feet as a function of time (local) is represented by the solid line.  The viable hiking window is bracketed by two vertical lines and 
highlighted, with the circle representing the latest start time for a viable hike.  What are the criteria for a viable hike? I'm so glad you asked.  
They are 1 hour of daylight and 1 hour of exposed beach (tide level NGT 2 feet).
