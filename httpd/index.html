    <p>This explanatory data visualization is in fulfillment of the requirements for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Project 6: "Make an Effective Data 
	Visualizations." The visualization shows the user viable windows to make the ~2 mile hike between Seattle's Carkeek and Golden Gardens parks, via beach 
	exposed at low tide, as well as to understand how the viable hiking window is determined.  A chart is displayed for each of the next four viable days, 
	from the selected day (initial visualization is the current day).  The tide data in feet relative to MLLW (Mean Lower Low Water) as a function of time 
	(local) is represented by the solid grey line.  The viable hiking window is bracketed by two red vertical lines and highlighted in orange, with the blue 
	circle representing the latest start time for a viable hike.  Interactive features consist of a tooltip (active when mousing over line plot) and 3 buttons
	which toggle the tide cutoff (~ 2 feet relative to MLLW) as a blue line, sunrise/sunset by orange/grey lines, or both.

    <p>You can learn more about this hike, here: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/seattlemetrobushiking/main-page/in-city-hikes/carkeek-park-and-beach-walk-to-ballard" target="_blank">Seattle Metro Bus Hiking</a>.  
	   If you are trying to determine when to make the hike between two of Seattle's most beautiful parks, you may find the interactive features helpful.  You 
	   may enter or select a date, then submit it via the button that says.......wait for it....submit.  Hovering on the tide level line will display a tooltip 
	   which gives the local time to the nearest 6 minute interval and the tide level to the nearest foot.  The not so shiny drab buttons will show add
	   horizontal or vertical lines representing the tide limit (~ 2ft) and sunrise (orange) and sunset (grey) times.
    </p>
       
    <p>The current processed data extends from August 21st 2015 through August 20th 2016.  The python processing script that feeds this .js visualization is now
	command line executable with a start and end date as command line arguments.  This allows the data to be periodically updated.  The next update will be no later than April 18 2016.

	The solid grey line represents the tide level ,in feet relative to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW), as function of time (local).  The red dashed vertical lines  
	represent the viable hike window (daylight present and 1 hour of tide level NGT 2 feet).  The blue circle indicates the latest start time. Tide level 
	threshold (blue line), and sunrise/sunset times (orange/grey lines), are toggled via the buttons above the figure.

    <p> All code and code history can be accessed via the projects Github Repo <a href="https://github.com/baumanab/seattle_tides" target="_blank">Carkeek Tides Github Repo</a>. 
	    Data was acquired and processed via python, primarily using the urllib2 and PANDAS libraries.  A visualization of the processed data was constructed 
		from Javascript (.js) using the Dimple, D3, and Moment libraries.  The data processing code has been refactored into a command line exectuble python
		script, that accepts a begin and end data as arguments <a href="https://github.com/baumanab/seattle_tides/blob/master/carkeek_tide_data.py" target="blank">Data processing script</a>.
		A data processing and exploration ipython notebook, describing initial data processing and exploration is available in the project Github Repo with an	html version here <a href="sandbox.html" target="_blank">Data Wrangling Sandbox</a>.	
		
		<h3>The general data acquisition and processing steps are: </h3>
 
	 <ol>

		<li> Query NOAA data (<a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/" target="_blank">NOAA COOPS API</a>) for the main Seattle station, 
		returning tide level predictions (feet relative to Mean Lower Low Water) for 1 year, at 6 minute intervals, as a JSON (Javascript Object Notation) object. </li>
		<li> Convert tide data to a PANDAS DataFrame (DF) and clean the data </li>
		<li> Transform tide levels to those at Carkeek park (main station level + 5.5%) </li>
		<li> Calculate sunrise and sunset times at Carkeek park </li>
		<li> Determine when hiking criteria are met (1 hour of daylight, 1 hour of exposed beach) as well as latest start time. </li>
		<li> Export the data as a TSV (Tab Separated Values) </li>
		<li> .js scripts pick up the TSV (hosted on the github repo) and perform additional DateTime processing and data subsetting, 
		     to enable the visualization.</li>
	 </ol>	

    <h3> This project is still ongoing and the to-do list includes:</h3>
	 <ul>
		<li> Refactor JS, particularly breaking the charting function into pieces </li>
		<li> Add a color code to the drop down calendar indicating viable days, to help the user select a start day. </li>
		<li> Increase the precision of the tide level tool tip to 1 floating decimal </li>
		<li> Apply a responsive web framework (bootstrap or flexbox) and re-style this site. </li>
		<li> Re-work the chart svg and draw function for responsiveness. </li>
	 </ul>
	
    <h3>Disclaimer and Assumptions:</h3>

	 <ul>
		<li> Daylight estimated as 30 minutes from sunrise to sunset </li>
		<li> Sufficient exposed beach: tide level NGT ~2ft </li>
		<li> Weather and wave conditions were not considered </li>
		<li> Distance of hike is ~ 2 miles </li>
		<li> Time to make the hike estimated at ~ 1 hour based on distance and the length of time it takes an average adult to walk a mile 
		     (15 minutes) + time to smell the roses, or geoducks as the case may be. </li>
		<li> Start times were calculated as 6 minutes until the tide level relative to MLLW is NGT 2 feet, so, the water level may be predicted to be slightly higher than 2 feet at start.  </li>
		<li> use this data at your own risk, the results and assumptions need testing.  I plan to test them personally on nice, sunny days :) </li>
	 </ul>
