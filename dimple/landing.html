 The explanatory data visualization below is in fulfillment of the requirements for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Project 6: "Make an Effective Data Visualization."  The data visualization is designed to help the user determine when to make the ~2 mile hike between two Seattle Parks, Carkeek and Golden Gardens, via beach exposed at low tide.  A chart is displayed for each of the next four viable days, from the selected day (initial visualization is the current day).

The tide data in feet as a function of time (local) is represented by the solid line.  The viable hiking window is bracketed by two vertical lines and highlighted, with the circle representing the latest start time for a viable hike.  What are the criteria for a viable hike? I'm so glad you asked.  They are 1 hour of daylight and 1 hour of exposed beach (tide level NGT 2 feet).

You can learn more about this hike, here: [insert link]

All code and code history can be accessed via the projects Github Repo [insert link]. Data was acquired and processed via a python scripts, primarily using the urllib2 and PANDAS libraries.  A visualization of the processed data was constructed from Javascript (.js) using the Dimple, D3, and Moment libraries.  A data processing and exploration ipython notebook is here [insert link] with an html version here [insert link].  The general data acquisition and processing steps are:

- query NOAA data (NOAA COOPS API [insert link]) for the main Seattle station, returning tide level predictions for 1 year, at 6 minute intervals, as a JSON (Javascript Object Notation) object
- convert tide data to a PANDAS DataFrame (DF)
- Transform tide levels to those at Carkeek park (main station level + 5.5%)
- Calculate sunrise and sunset times at Carkeek park
- Determine when hiking criteria are met (1 hour of daylight, 1 hour of exposed beach) as well as latest start time
- Export the data as a TSV (Tab Separated Values)

The TSV is the rolled up into a visualization per this code [insert link].

If you are trying to determine when to make the hike between two of Seattle's most beautiful parks, you may find the interactive features helpful.  You may enter or select a date, then submit it via the button that says.......wait for it....submit.  Hovering on the tide level line with display a tooltip which gives the local time to the nearest 6 minute interval and the tide level to the nearest foot.

Caveats:

The data is currently static, representing processed data from August 21st 2015 to August 20th 2016, and is not yet periodically updated.

This project is still ongoing and the to-do list consists of:

- Refactor JS, particularly breaking the charting function into pieces
- Refactor and repackage python code for server execution.  The sandbox code is in the order I took to solve particular data processing challenges and is not well organized or efficient.
- Extend the exploratory data analysis (EDA) using R to summarize and visually explore the data, with particular focus on distribution of viable days.
- Add a color code to the drop down calendar indicating viable days, to help the user select a start day.
- Increase the precision of the tide level tool tip to 1 floating decimal
- Set up the query and data processing on this server to update the data each week.
- Style this site.
